    you make a change to any data configuration files related to this client.

    up to date. Call this to force the index to match the data we have.
  </p>
  <h6>Reindex Index</h6>
  <p>
    This should only be used if something changes in the search configuration file.

    happend automatically so it is unlikely that this should ever be called.
